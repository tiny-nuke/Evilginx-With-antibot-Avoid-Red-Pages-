# Evilginx With antibot Avoid-Red-Pages
Modified Evilginx with Cloudflare Integration and AntiBot-Enhanced Office 365 Phishlet

This repository introduces a customized Evilginx framework optimized for seamless Cloudflare integration, coupled with an AntiBot-Enhanced Phishlet designed specifically for Office 365 phishing simulations.
Key Features:

    Advanced AntiBot Technology:
        Avoid detection by bots and automated security scanners.
        Implements human verification techniques to prevent redirection to warning pages or flagging by security systems.

    Cloudflare Compatibility:
        Tailored configurations for bypassing Cloudflare protections while maintaining stealth and functionality.

    Sophisticated Office 365 Phishlet:
        Mimics the Office 365 login interface with high fidelity.
        Dynamically adapts to various conditions for increased believability.

    Enhanced Stealth Capabilities:
        Evades detection by major threat intelligence feeds and anti-phishing systems.
        Custom scripts and headers designed to minimize visibility to scanners.

    Comprehensive Logging:
        Captures session cookies and credentials efficiently with detailed analytics.

Why Use AntiBot?

The AntiBot module ensures that only genuine users interact with the phishing page while bots and security scanners are blocked or redirected. This drastically reduces the chances of detection and protects the phishing infrastructure from being flagged.
